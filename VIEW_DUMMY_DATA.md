3. **Leave recent blocks incomplete** (e.g., "2 weeks before" tasks)
4. **Mix assignees** to show collaboration between client and JS

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

**If "Create Demo Timelines" fails:**
- Make sure you clicked "Seed Templates" first
- Check browser console for error messages
- Templates must be seeded before creating timelines

**If no timelines show:**
- Click "Create Demo Timelines" button
- Wait for success message
- Page should auto-refresh to show timelines

That's it! Your dummy data is now accessible and ready to explore in your frontend! ðŸŽ‰
